# About This Resource

This resource was created for personal use on my own server. That is the whole reason it is not very configurable compared to alternate weapon shops.
**It has various weapon shops located around Los Santos but will require basic level LUA knowledge to add/remove/edit locations.**

### Disclaimer

At the time of posting this, the OX_Lib feature was temporarily removed, however it will be added back into the system soon in which a Config for MenuV/OX_Lib will be added.

Obviously, MenuV is a requirement to use this.
